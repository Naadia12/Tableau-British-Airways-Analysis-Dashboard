Project Overview

British Airways is working to improve customer satisfaction and perceived value for money across its global flight network. This dashboard analyses passenger review data to understand how traveller type, route, and region affect satisfaction levels. The goal is to identify opportunities for operational and service improvements.

Key Business Questions

* How does traveller type impact overall satisfaction and value for money?
* Which flight routes demonstrate the highest and lowest passenger satisfaction?
* Are there regional differences in passenger satisfaction that require targeted action?


Key Insights

* Business travellers report the highest average satisfaction, especially in cabin service and value for money
* London to New York is among the top routes with strong ratings, while other routes reveal service gaps
* Passenger satisfaction varies by region, with some areas consistently scoring lower, indicating room for localised improvements
* Dashboard Features


Business Recommendations

* Improve Service on Underperforming Routes: Use feedback from lower-rated routes to identify common issues and implement targeted improvements
