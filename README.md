British Airways – Passenger Satisfaction Tableau Dashboard

Business Problem
British Airways is seeking to enhance customer satisfaction and the perceived value for money across its global flight network. Drawing on passenger review data, this dashboard examines how traveller type, route, and region influence satisfaction — highlighting opportunities for operational and service improvements.

Key Business Insights
Business travellers report the highest average satisfaction
Business-class passengers consistently provide higher ratings across various review categories, particularly in cabin service and value for money.

Top 5 routes reveal significant variations in average ratings
Routes such as London to New York receive stronger scores, while others show clear gaps — suggesting that certain routes may benefit from targeted service enhancements.

Passenger satisfaction varies considerably by region
Average ratings differ by origin region, with some areas consistently scoring lower. This indicates a need for localised quality assurance or better alignment with passenger expectations.

Recommendations for British Airways
Improve service on underperforming routes
Use passenger feedback from lower-rated routes to identify common issues and implement specific improvements.

Strengthen the business traveller experience
High satisfaction scores in this segment indicate strong perceived value — BA should maintain this and consider loyalty-building initiatives.

Address regional satisfaction disparities
Focus on consistently low-scoring regions to understand root causes and ensure service standards are met globally.
